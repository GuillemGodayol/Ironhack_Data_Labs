# Lab | Analysis Lectures

## Introduction
The goal of this lab is for you to read real data analytics projects and give some feedback on them. 

## Getting started
Choose **one** of the lectures below and try to give your opinion about it, as well as answer the proposed questions. 

Feel free to read all of them and make some comments if you are interested!

## Lectures
### Lecture 1 - A Brief Exploration of Baseball Statistics
**Reference:** [A Brief Exploration of Baseball Statistics](https://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/data-analysis-with-python-19434f5d6324)

The first lecture is related to finding a relation between certain baseball statistics and the players salary.

**Only read it until the T-test part!**

Pay attention to how the author began his analysis: 
- He defined his goal.
- He asked himself some questions.
- He formed some perfectly defined hypotheses.
- He studied the raw data and made some decisions based on what he saw. 
- He checked that his code worked as intended by examining his dataframes. 
- He knew exactly which visualizations he would need to try to answer his questions. 

Think about the process you've been following during your current project. 
- Is it similar to what the author of the article did?
- What do you think you can improve in your next project by reading how the author planned his analysis? 
- Is there anything you think the author missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

### Lecture 2 - I was looking for a house, so I built a web scraper in Python!
**Reference:** [I was looking for a house, so I built a web scraper in Python!](https://towardsdatascience.com/looking-for-a-house-build-a-web-scraper-to-help-you-5ab25badc83e)

The second lecture is related to scraping the data from a real state website. 

After reading the article...
- Try to access the *robots.txt* file of [Giphy](https://giphy.com) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) as explained in the article. Can you scrape those web pages? Do some research and try to understand those files. 
- Did you do some web scraping in your project? Did you have to use some of the *tricks* the author used regarding time sleep, user-agent, ...? Why? Explain your experience. 
- Is there anything you think the author missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

### Lecture 3 - Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)
**Reference:** [Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)](https://www.ted.com/talks/lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks#t-316284)

The third lecture is a presentation about the insights gotten from a TED Talks data analysis.

After watching the video...
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite? 
He adapted the visualisations to the mood of the speech, which was in a humouristic way. And a very easy understandable for general public, maybe not used to see statistics visualisations. My favourite was the basic one with the 3 main topics he was talking about: Topic, Delivery and Visuals as it was very basic but very useful showing it at the beggining of each topic with colour if the topic was not explained or grey if it was.
- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across? It was a very good speech, adapted to the his public and making fun on some curious statistics from TedTalk. As it is not a serious speech, he adapted the language to the speech and make some jokes even with some of the statistics he had talked about seconds before. I guess his objective was to show some curious statistics from Ted Talk without being boring and he achieved that.
- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen? The presentation was not about a trascendental topic, but his way of speaking and explaining the results he got, keeped me glued to the screen. I was waiting for some more statistics!
- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him? I was expecting a small 'automated speech' on stage. It was not there although he left a web page with a pad to create our own speech, so maybe I can check it. In my opinion, this is a good way to check if the speech has 'touched' the public or not in a deep way, looking at the visits on this web page. And maybe he can use this statistics to prepare a new speech...
